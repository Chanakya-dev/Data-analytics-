# **Employee Management Dashboard – Roadmap with Detailed Project Goals**

---

## **Phase 1: Foundations – Basic Structure & Calculations**

**Goal:** Build a **clean and structured employee dataset** with core calculations to understand employee age, tenure, total compensation, and eligibility checks.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Create workbook with sheets: `Employee_Data`, `Salary`, `Dashboard`.
* Enter **all employee information**: ID, Name, Department, DOB, Joining Date, Base Salary, Bonus.
* Format data for readability: headers, currency for salaries, date formats, freeze header rows.
* Implement **basic calculations**:

  * Age of employees using DOB.
  * Tenure in years using joining date.
  * Total Compensation = Base Salary + Bonus.
* Add **logical checks**:

  * Bonus eligibility (e.g., eligible if tenure ≥ 2 years).
* Add **error handling**: handle missing salary or bonus entries gracefully.
* Apply **text functions** to clean names: split full names, proper capitalization.

---

## **Phase 2: Intermediate Data Handling – Validation & Lookups**

**Goal:** Make the dataset **error-free, validated, and semi-automated** by linking departments and grades using lookup formulas.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* **Data Validation:**

  * Dropdowns for Departments, Bonus eligibility.
  * Error messages for invalid inputs.
* **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicates, trim extra spaces, clean text, fix inconsistencies.
* **Lookup Automation:**

  * Automatically fetch Department Head for each employee.
  * Determine salary grade based on total compensation.
* **Sorting & Filtering:**

  * Sort employees by Department → Salary.
  * Filter employees by bonus eligibility or tenure.
* Implement **what-if analysis** for quick scenarios, like changing bonus percentage or salary slabs.

---

## **Phase 3: Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – Summarization**

**Goal:** **Summarize and visualize key employee insights** for quick decision-making.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Create **Pivot Tables**:

  * Employees count by department.
  * Average salary per department.
  * Total bonus distributed per department.
* Add **calculated fields** to analyze performance metrics.
* Create **Pivot Charts**: column/bar/line charts showing salaries, bonuses, headcount.
* Add **Slicers/Timelines** for interactive filtering by department or bonus eligibility.
* The dataset now supports **dynamic summaries without manual calculation**.

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Formulas – Dynamic Calculations**

**Goal:** Implement **complex calculations and dynamic metrics** to analyze employee performance and multi-criteria data.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Calculate **weighted performance score** for each employee using `SUMPRODUCT()`.
* Use **dynamic arrays**: automatically list unique departments, top performers.
* Implement **two-way lookups** (INDEX + MATCH + MATCH) for advanced cross-referencing.
* Use **dynamic ranges** to automatically expand formulas as new data is added.
* The dataset becomes **intelligent and self-updating**, requiring minimal manual updates.

---

## **Phase 5: Data Visualization & Reporting – Dashboard**

**Goal:** Build an **interactive employee dashboard** that clearly visualizes performance, compensation, and departmental metrics.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Add **charts**: salaries, bonus distributions, employee age distribution.
* Add **advanced charts**: waterfall for bonus distribution, radar for performance comparison.
* Apply **conditional formatting**: heatmaps for top performers, color codes for high/low salaries.
* Add **sparklines** in rows to track trends per employee.
* Use **Form Controls**: dropdowns, checkboxes, scrollbars for interactive filtering.
* Create a dashboard that **summarizes all key metrics in a single view**, ready for presentation.

---

## **Phase 6: Power Tools – Data Modeling & Automation Prep**

**Goal:** Make the system **automation-ready** by connecting multiple datasets and building relational models.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Use **Power Query** to import multiple employee and payroll datasets.
* Merge and clean data automatically; pivot/unpivot columns as needed.
* Use **Power Pivot** to create data models linking employees, departments, and payroll tables.
* Create **DAX measures**: total salary, average bonus, department-wise performance metrics.
* Apply **time intelligence functions**: calculate yearly trends, YTD salary/bonus totals.
* The system now **automatically processes raw data into a structured, ready-to-analyze model**.

---

## **Phase 7: Automation with Macros/VBA – Full Automation**

**Goal:** Automate **all repetitive tasks and interactive features** for a fully self-sufficient dashboard.

**Project Changes / Achievements in this Phase:**

* Record and edit **macros** to automate formatting, data refresh, and calculations.
* Implement **event-driven macros**: run updates on button click or sheet changes.
* Create **simple UserForms** to enter new employees or update salaries.
* Automate **dashboard updates**, including Pivot Tables, charts, and slicers.
* After this phase, the dashboard becomes **fully automated**, requiring minimal manual intervention.
